# SudoMagic POP Tools

This repo is a collection of tools for working with POPs. Some of these OPs are targeted at common operations - and others are focused on data manipulation. While you're welcome to download the repo itself, you can also just use the `TOX` files published in the release.

## Tools Inventory

### base_lat_lon_to_xyz

This COMP converts latitude and longitude coordinates into XYZ coords. The primary mechanic for using this COMP is to load a `.csv` file from dist that has a column for `lat` and `lon` which contains the latitude and longitude coordinates you'd like to convert. Alternatively, you can pass in a POP that has a vec2 attribute called latLng which contains those values e.g. `vec2(lat, lon)`

The assumed radius of the sphere the coordinates is projected onto has a unit value of 1.

### base_sharp_splat_point_cloud

This COMP is used to load an splat generated by apple's sharp model and represent the splats as a point cloud. While the `.ply` files produced work well for splat viewers, retrieving the color data for a generalized point cloud requires some additional color transformation. This transformation is achieved with a `Math Mix` POP, and this component is intended as a convenience to no need to remember that formula.
